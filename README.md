# Selection-Sort
Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion.

Algorithm:

Step 1 − Set MIN to location 0

Step 2 − Search the minimum element in the list

Step 3 − Swap with value at location MIN

Step 4 − Increment MIN to point to next element

Step 5 − Repeat until list is sorted.
